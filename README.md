# Description
We aim to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site. This will be a place where developers can publish blog posts. This will also give the ability to comment on other developersâ€™ posts. Once built, we will deploy the site to Heroku. We also will use Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
